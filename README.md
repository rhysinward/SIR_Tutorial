# SIR Model Problem Sheet

## Overview

This repository contains materials for a tutorial exploring the **SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)** model, a foundational mathematical framework in epidemiology. The tutorial is designed to help students understand the dynamics of infectious diseases and how key parameters influence epidemic outcomes.

## Objectives

By working through this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand the concept of the basic reproduction number (**R₀**) and its importance in epidemiology.
2. Learn how the SIR model is constructed and used to estimate **R₀**.
3. Explore how changes in the **transmission rate** and **recovery rate** affect **R₀** and epidemic dynamics.
4. Analyse the impact of intervention timing on the **overall epidemic size**.

## Contents

The folder contains:

- `SIR_and_R0.Rmd`: An RMarkdown file with the full problem sheet, including code, explanations, and exercises.
- `SIR_and_R0.html`: A pre-rendered HTML version of the problem sheet for quick access and review.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To work with the RMarkdown file, you will need the following:

- R (version 4.0 or later)
- RStudio (recommended)
- Required R packageslisted in the RMarkdown file

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
